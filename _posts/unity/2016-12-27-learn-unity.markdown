## My Original Desire to Learn Programming.
My original desire to learn programming centered around making games. I
learned to program by reading other NPCs (Non Playable Characters) scripts
in a game called [Graal Online](http://classic.graalonline.com/), of which
has a large following (WAH??). There was a simple level editor of which I
spent hours playing around with. The level editor had a simple script
editor with C like syntax. That is where I discovered my love for
programming and games. I hope, on this adventure, to rediscover them.

So I am learning Unity and hopefully will make some neeto VR games.

I kept game programming all the way through college. Granted I rarely wrote
anything passed concept, hand wrote physic engines, game engines, and
eventually scope creeped to the point of never completing anything. But now,
I want to revive that passion and see what the world of game programming
looks like now. So I decided to learn Unity3d. I no longer have to worry
about all the details, I can just focus on programming, and the unity way of
doing things.

## Unity?
Yes Unity.

### Learning Unity
Unity has such great tutorials! I listened to them at 2x speed since they
are largely aimed at both the novice Unity user, and programmer in general.
Barring the minor frustration of having someone explain how methods,
variables, public, static, etc. etc. work, the tutorials were well worth it.


So far I have finished the following:

* [Roll a Ball](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial)
* [Space Shooter](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter-tutorial)

I added a bit of flair to my version of the space shooter to learn more
about the system.

### The Code
Unfortunately Unity does not appear to have the source control that I am use
to. I am very use to using `git`. Instead, they want Asset Servers, of which
I know nothing about.


So for my space shooter I have made all the extra code / divergent code
available on my [github account](https://github.com/michaelbpaulson/unity-space-shooter).

There are only a few differences between my project and the tutorial. They
are centered around level challenge and when the player dies, all asteroids
explode.

I will not be going over any of the code for that, but as I progress,
hopefully, I'll make a few posts about cool tips and tricks I have found
for Game Programming and VR related gems.
